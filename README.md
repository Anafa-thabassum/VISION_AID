# VisionAid

VisionAid is a **mobile application** designed to assist **visually impaired, low-vision individuals, and elderly users with reading difficulties** by identifying objects *and* reading text aloud in real time. With VisionAid, users can navigate their surroundings more confidently and independently.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 **Real-Time Object Recognition**  
  Detects objects using the device camera and provides audio feedback.

- 🔡 **Text Recognition (OCR)**  
  Reads text from the environment (e.g., signs, books) aloud to the user.

- 🗣️ **Audio Output**  
  Converts visual input into spoken words for enhanced accessibility.

- 📱 **Mobile-First Interface**  
  Built to run smoothly on smartphone platforms.

## 🧠 How It Works

VisionAid captures frames from the phone camera and sends them through intelligent visual processing algorithms. The app then identifies objects and text present in the camera view and provides **voice-based feedback**, enabling users to:

- Navigate their surroundings
- Recognize objects
- Read printed text

This helps visually challenged users perform daily tasks more independently and confidently.
